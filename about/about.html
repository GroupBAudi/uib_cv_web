                    The name's Nicholas. I only have simple skills compared to the others in my class. I have an average skills of programming (this shit ain't even programming), problem solving, and logic (although compared to the others, mine's is child's play).
                    I have a huge interest in racing especially rally (classic rally, rally cross, heck even dakar).
                    I've been a huge racing fan since I was 3 or maybe 4 after watching 2 Fast and 2 Furious and playing Need for Speed (any Need for Speed after Underground of course because I was born in the wrong time)
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-light">
                    My interest on racing grew after discovering any simulator title even if it's arcady by professional standards such as Race Driver : GRID (I highly recommend it if you are a casual racer looking for a challenge unlike Need for Speed games which uses catch-up feature).
                    At that time, I've also grown an interest in shooter game. Not just any shooter, but RPG shooter (say, like STALKER, truly one of a kind game).
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-light">
                    Almost every shooter games treats you like an anime main character where you can take many 7.62s to the chest and not have a fucking hole on your chest.
                    STALKER is different though, you are the same as your enemy (AI of course). Even though we have an armor rated to stop 7.62s, we can still die from 9mms bullet 'wound' if we got shot enough.
                    Another neat feature is your character can die if your body parts 'health' can be depleted by taking enough damage which causes penalties such as slower movement speed to the point of crawl, piss poor accuracy and aim-shake just like your mother see what's under your bed, or even dying altogether.
