                    I have a huge interest in racing especially rally (classic rally, rally cross, heck even dakar).
                    I've been a huge racing fan since I was 3 or maybe 4 after watching 2 Fast and 2 Furious and playing Need for Speed (any Need for Speed after Underground of course because I was born in the wrong time)
                    My interest on racing grew after discovering any simulator title even if it's arcady by professional standards such as Race Driver : GRID (I highly recommend it if you are a casual racer looking for a challenge unlike Need for Speed games which uses catch-up feature).
                    At that time, my interest on rally games also grew, because I've became more bored 'racing on asphalt'. And I then I discover DiRT Rally series.

                <p class="text-light">
                    Compared to the other titles that I've mentioned before, DiRT Rally is like Dark Souls of racing games. One wrong mistake and you either roll of the cliff or suffer catastrophic damage,
                    which would determine if I could go to the next stage without the car breaking down. Also, if you think it's just NFS but on gravel, one mistake costs you around 15 seconds penalty, which means you drop about 4-5 positions.
                    Yeah... this is definitely not NFS, just a whole different game.
